      <p class="paragraph">
        Agile methods were developed for use by small programming teams who could
        work together in the same room and communicate informally. Agile methods have
        therefore been mostly used for the development of small and medium-sized systems.
        Of course, the need for faster delivery of software, which is more suited to customer
        needs, also applies to larger systems. Consequently, there has been a great deal of
        interest in scaling agile methods to cope with larger systems, developed by large
        organizations.

      <p class="paragraph">
        Denning et al. (2008) argue that the only way to avoid common software engineering problems, such as systems that don’t meet customer needs and budget overruns, is
        to find ways of making agile methods work for large systems. Leffingwell (2007) discusses which agile practices scale to large systems development. Moore and Spens
        (2008) report on their experience of using an agile approach to develop a large medical
        system with 300 developers working in geographically distributed teams.

      <h2>How Large System Development Differs</h2>
      <p>
        Large software system development is different from small system development
        in a number of ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Large systems are usually collections of separate, communicating systems...</li>
        <li>Large systems are “brownfield systems” (Hopkins and Jenkins, 2008)...</li>
        <li>Where several systems are integrated to create a system...</li>
        <li>Large systems and their development processes are often constrained by external rules...</li>
        <li>Large systems have a long procurement and development time...</li>
        <li>Large systems usually have a diverse set of stakeholders...</li>
      </ol>

    <section class="bello">
      <h2>Perspectives on Scaling Agile</h2>
      <p>There are two perspectives on the scaling of agile methods:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Scaling up</strong> — using agile methods to develop large software systems that cannot be developed by a single small team.</li>
        <li><strong>Scaling out</strong> — introducing agile methods across a large organization with many years of software development experience.</li>
      </ol>

      <p class="paragraph">
        Agile methods have to be adapted to cope with large systems engineering.
        Leffingwell (2007) argues that it is essential to maintain the fundamentals of agile
        methods — flexible planning, frequent system releases, continuous integration,
        test-driven development, and good team communications. The critical adaptations that have to be introduced include:
      </p>

      <h3>Critical Adaptations for Large Systems</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>For large systems development, it is not possible to focus only on the code...</li>
        <li>Cross-team communication mechanisms have to be designed and used...</li>
        <li>Continuous integration is practically impossible across many teams, but frequent builds and releases are essential...</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Adoption Differences & Challenges</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Small software companies that develop software products have been among the
        most enthusiastic adopters of agile methods...
      </p>

      <h3>Why Introducing Agile in Large Companies Is Difficult</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Project managers without agile experience may resist change...</li>
        <li>Large organizations often have strict quality procedures and standards...</li>
        <li>Agile methods work best with high-skill teams, which may vary in big companies...</li>
        <li>There may be cultural resistance to agile methods...</li>
      </ol>

        Introducing and sustaining the use of agile methods across a large organization is
        a process of cultural change...

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Agile methods</strong> are incremental approaches focusing on rapid development...</li>
        <li>The choice between agile and plan-driven approaches depends on project context...</li>
        <li><strong>Extreme Programming (XP)</strong> integrates practices like frequent releases...</li>
        <li>XP emphasizes automated tests before feature implementation...</li>
        <li>Scaling agile requires up-front design and documentation...</li>
