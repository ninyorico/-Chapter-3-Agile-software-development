        <Section class="sectionismonin">
            <p class="paragraphonin">Agile approaches to software development consider design and implementation to be
                the central activities in the software process. They incorporate other activities, such as
                requirements elicitation and testing, into design and implementation. By contrast, a
                plan-driven approach to software engineering identifies separate stages in the software process with
                outputs
                associated with each stage. The outputs from one stage are
                used as a basis for planning the following process activity. Figure 3.2 shows the distinctions between
                plan-driven and agile approaches to system specification</p>
            <p class="paragraphonin">In a plan-driven approach, iteration occurs within activities with formal documents
                used to communicate
                between stages of the process. For example, the requirements will evolve and, ultimately, a requirements
                specification will be produced.
                This is then an input to the design and implementation process. In an agile approach,
                iteration occurs across activities. Therefore, the requirements and the design are
                developed together, rather than separately</p>

            <p class="figureonin">Figure 3.2 Plan-driven and agile development</p>
            <p class="paragraphonin">A plan-driven software process can support incremental development and delivery. It
                is perfectly feasible to
                allocate requirements and plan the design and development phase as a series of increments. An agile
                process
                is not inevitably code-focused
                and it may produce some design documentation. As I discuss in the following section, the agile
                development
                team may decide to include a documentation ‘spike’,
                where, instead of producing a new version of a system, the team produce system
                documentation.</p>

            <p class="paragraphonin">In fact, most software projects include practices from plan-driven and agile
                approaches. To decide on the balance between a plan-based and an agile approach,
                you have to answer a range of technical, human, and organizational questions:</p>

                    <div class="listonin-content">
                        Is it important to have a very detailed specification and design before moving to
                        implementation?
                        If so, you probably need to use a plan-driven approach.

                        Is an incremental delivery strategy, where you deliver the software to customers and get rapid
                        feedback from them, realistic?
                        If so, consider using agile methods.

                        How large is the system that is being developed? Agile methods are most effective when the
                        system can be developed with a small co-located team
                        who can communicate informally. This may not be possible for large systems that require larger
                        development teams,
                        so a plan-driven approach may have to be used.

                        What type of system is being developed? Systems that require a lot of analysis before
                        implementation
                        (e.g., real-time systems with complex timing requirements) usually need a fairly detailed design
                        to carry out this analysis.
                        A plan-driven approach may be best in those circumstances.

                        What is the expected system lifetime? Long-lifetime systems may require more design
                        documentation
                        to communicate the original intentions of the system developers to the support team.
                        However, agile supporters argue that documentation is often not kept up to date and is less
                        useful for long-term maintenance.

                        What technologies are available to support system development?
                        Agile methods often rely on good tools to keep track of an evolving design.
                        If your IDE lacks good visualization and analysis tools, more design documentation may be
                        required.

                        If the development team is distributed or if part of the work is outsourced,
                        you may need design documents to communicate across teams and plan these in advance.

                    <div class="listonin-content">
                        Are there cultural issues that may affect system development?
                        Traditional engineering organizations have a culture of plan-based development,
                        which usually requires extensive design documentation.

                        How skilled are the designers and programmers in the development team?
                        Agile methods often require higher skill levels than plan-based approaches.
                        If your team has lower skill levels, you might assign your best developers to design and others
                        to coding.

                    <div class="listonin-content">
                        Is the system subject to external regulation?
                        If it must be approved by an external regulator (e.g., the FAA for aircraft software),
                        you’ll probably need to produce detailed documentation as part of the system safety case.

            <p class="paragraphonin">In reality, the issue of whether a project can be labelled as plan-driven or agile
                is
                not very important. Ultimately, the primary concern of buyers of a software system
                is whether or not they have an executable software system that meets their needs and
                does useful things for the individual user or the organization. In practice, many companies who claim to
                have used agile methods have adopted some agile practices and
                have integrated these with their plan-driven processes.</p>
